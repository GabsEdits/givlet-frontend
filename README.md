A platform to make charity funding fun, easy, and impactful.

**WIP**: This project is currently a work in progress.

## The problem this project is solving

When it comes to changing the world, funding is a quintessential part of any journey. The greatest innovations that make our everyday-lives better have typically been achieved through huge investments. Yet surprisingly, nearly 70% of nonprofit funding comes from individuals (source: NP Trust), making ordinary people a driving factor behind any change. Unfortunately, individual philanthropy is becoming less common, and most people aren't aware of the huge impact their pocket change can bring.

## The solution to the problem

Ordinary people are an untapped goldmine for funding important changes, and our goal is to create a platform that uses key strategies to change that. Firstly, our platform will connect changemakers with the public, allowing nonprofits, scientists, etc. to directly reach potential funding and advertise why they should receive it. It will also allow users who wish to fund several nonprofits/projects to do so in a centralized, trustworthy environment. Secondly, by implementing social features (following/sharing charities, praise) and gamifying elements (donation leaderboards, ranks, instant feedback) to the platform, we will grow and retain a large userbase, attracting nonprofits. Combined with other strategies, this will empower real change.

This project also contributes to SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals, as it aims to create a platform that connects changemakers with the public, fostering collaboration and partnerships for sustainable development.

## Development & Design

### Tech Stack

This project uses Svelte, SvelteKit, and TypeScript for the frontend, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Design Choices

The design was havily inspired by the Apple's Liquid Glass design language, a brand new language made by Apple for it's products in 2026. I've tried to make it as simple and intuitive as possible, while still being visually appealing. The design is also responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
